# Notes on the Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

These notes come from the book *Expectations: Teaching Writing from the Reader's Perspective* by George D. Gopen except where indicated by a specific citation to his other work *The Sense of Structure: Writing From the Readerâ€™s Perspective* (Gopen, 2004a; Gopen, 2004b).


## Some Consolidated Information 

Dr. Gopen has several bold offsets describing reader expectations scattered throughout his book. I'm collecting the ones I noted here for quick review, along with some of his suggestions about how to write given the reader's expectations.

### Statements of reader expectations and some associated advice

* Reader expectation: **"Readers of English have reflectively fixed expectations of where in the structure of any unit of discourse to expect the arrival of certain kinds of substance."** p. 11
  * Advice: Don't violate reader expectations unless doing so intentionally for a specific rhetorical effect.
  * Advice: **"Whenever possible, try to locate the various types of substancee in the structural locations where readers expect those types of substance to arrive."** p. 78
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the action of a sentence to be articulated by the verb."** p. 25
  * Advice: Be careful not to hide the true action of a sentence in nominalizations.
  * Advice: **"Usually express the action of a sentence as a verb."** p. 32
  * Advice: **"Usually use verbs only for expressing actions."** p. 33
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect every grammatical subject will be followed almost immediately by its verb."** p. 58
* Reader expectation: **"Readers tend to read a clause -- or a one-clause sentence -- as being the story of whoever or whatever shows up first."** p. 81
* Reader expectation: **"In a multiclause sentence, readers tend to read the entire sentence as the story of whoever or whatever shows up first in the main clause."** p. 88
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the material at the beginning of a sentence to provide a connection backward to the sentence that precedes it."** p. 90
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect that materials to the left contextualize anything that comes to its right. Readers expect that the occupants of the topic position contextualize the reader for the rest of the sentence."** p. 101
  * Advice: **"Whose story? + backwards link = context"** p. 95
* Reader expectation: **"Today's readers of American English expect to find the most important information of a sentence located in a stress position."** p. 102
* Reader expectation: **"Contemporary readers of American English sentences expect to find the most important information in a stress position. A stress position is any moment of full syntactic closure."** p. 108
  * Advice: The colon has two main uses. In both instances, what precedes the colon should be able to be an independent sentence. What follows the colon redefines what preceded it. The second clause is capitalized. The other use of the colon is to introduce a list of examples. The second clause after the colon clarifies.
  * Advice: The semicolon is used where two clauses need to be connected in the same syntactic unit. The second clause is more important than the first and adds complexity.
  * Advice: The major punctuation marks that create stress points are the colon, the semicolon, and the period. The stress point is the end of the clause where the punctuation is used when full syntactic closure is achieved.
  * Advice: **"A sentence is too long when it contains more viable candidates for Stress positions than it has Stress positions. A sentence is too short when it contains no viable candidates for the Stress position."** p. 112
  * Advice: **"Fill every stress position with something stressworthy; and ensure that everything stressworthy occupies a stress position."** p. 113
  * Advice: **"You can use underlines for words to add stress when that word is difficult to move to the stress position because of grammar."** p. 118
  * Nouns carry more weight than pronouns.
  * Structural arrangements carries 85% of stress. Word choice carries 15%.
  * Multiple uses of the stress position:
    * Advice: **"The stress position of a sentence that ends a document should usually afford the reader a full sense of closure."** p. 160
    * Advice: **"The stress position that ends a segment or section of a document either should produce a document-ending kind of closure or should perform a more subtle two-stranded task -- bringing closure to the present section while leaning forward to introduce or link to the approaching section."** p. 160
    * Use the stress position to indicate a change in topic: 1) Place new information in the stress position. 2) New information is not self-explanatory. This indicates to the reader that more explanation is coming.
    * Muliple Strands (tells a story) - the subject of the story may be in the topic position for several sentences and new information about the story in the stress position for those.
    * Epistrophic Emphasis (repeat same phrase) - Repeat the same word or phrase in the stress position for several sentences. (Should be used infrequently.)
    * Intentional Anticlimax - Put less important information in the stress position. (Takes the edge off emphasis of bad news.)
  * Patterns related to the Topic position over mulitple sentences
    * Topic Changing (Chaining) - The key word in the topic position refers back to the same key word in the stress position of the previous sentence. (Produces a domino effect. Focuses on links and connectedness.)
    * Topic Stringing - The topic remains the same for several sentences. Allows complex information to be conveyed about the same topic.
    * **"Readers need more than just the building blocks of information; they need the instructions for assembly."** p. 169
    * The topic position indicates "who's story". Switching subjects in the topic position often in a paragraph can make it feel disjointed.
    * **"The reader will know to value one lexical string over all the others if the lexical string is also the topical string."** p. 176
    * **"Construct topic strings when you wish to develop a point of view or an argument continuously, from its basis to its conclusion"** p. 178
* Some points about paragraphs
  * For readers, the unit of thought is the paragraph. Nicely written sentences are not enough.
  * The five-sentence paragraph structure is too rigid for professional writing.
  * Paragraph's internal structure and place in larger context of document should be considered. Reader's interpret a paragraph as they read, sentence by sentence. We need to understand the distinction between the issue (topic), the point (intellectual claim), and the purpose (function performed in the discourse as a whole).
  * Paragraph Issue (What we normally think of as the topic.)
    * Whatever shows up in the first one to three sentences of a paragraph will be perceived as the paragraph issue by readers.
    * What does a paragraph do? It does one or more of the following. It offers cohesion. It presents unity. It indicates purpose. It raises an issue. It makes a point. It tells a story. It generates development. It provides coherence. It creates shape. p. 207
    * Reader expectations for paragraphs are similar to expectations for sentences. "Whose story is it?" is largely determined by what shows up at the beginning.
    * Narrative paragraphs don't need to articulate a point because they are establishing knowledge that will be supportive of points made later in the text. p. 211
  * Paragraph point
    * First paragraphs: readers expect the point of the opening paragraph to arrive at the end.
    * Last paragraphs: readers also expect the point of a concluding paragraph to arrive at the end.
    * Most medial paragraphs: readers expect the point at the beginning of the discussion.
    * Medial paragraphs with clear and dramatic point: point is at the end for dramatic effect.
    * Medial paragraphs with complexity and dramatic point: point is at the beginning of the discussion AND at the end.
    * One-sentence paragraphs: Should fill all rhetorical requirements for a paragraph - clearly stated issue, clearly ascertainable point, sufficient discussion to establish the point. (The issue can be stated in one sentence. The issue and the point are the same. All the discussion that supports the Point must have happened already in previous paragraphs or will happen immediately after the single-sentence paragraph.)
  * Paragraph purpose
    * Issue and Point look at the internal structure of paragraphs. Purpose is the role the paragraph plays in the larger unit of discourse. Purpose is the relationship between the current paragraph and the other paragraphs surrounding it before and after.
    * The purpose is a bit more nebulous to determine and articulate because it depends on the reader's perception of what is going on rhetorically in the rest of the work.
    * Writing and reading are acts of interpretation. The act of writing forces one through the act of interpretation. Writing and thinking can not be clearly separated from each other; nor should writing and reading. p. 236
  * Connections between paragraphs
    * In both sentences and paragraphs, the reader is looking for the connection between what came before and what is coming after. The options to help supply this is 1) signaling forward at the end of the previous paragraph; 2) motioning backward at the beginning of the new unit; or 3) doing both. p. 251
    * At the sentence level, the occupant of the stress position of the previous sentence often be the future linkage. But this is not necessary. Any important word in a sentence can become the old information in the topic position and take over the storyline.
    * Typical expectations of the reader for a new paragraph: 1) It may begin where the previous paragraph left off. 2) It might continue to develop the issue of the previous paragraph and start from where the previous paragraph started. 3) It might pick a detail from the previous paragraph to expand upon. 4) It might shift to a topic the reader has not been led to expect. (dramatic) Readers like to be told ASAP which of these is happening.
    * It's common to link back to the issue or the point of the previous paragraph.
* Generalizations of reader expectations:
  * Readers wish to be contextualized at the beginning of discourse units. (sentences, paragraphs)
  * Readers will look for context in the locations expected. (Topic position of sentence, Issue position of paragraph)
  * Readers have a great need for closure. They will give natural emphasis to the end of a unit of discourse. (End of sentence, End of first and last paragraphs)
 
### Paper revision steps and strategies

* Some general questions while revising:
  * In sentences, which piece of new information deserves the most emphasis? (How do you move that stressworthy information to the Stress position?)
  * Whose story is being told in the paragraph? (How do you move that information to the Issue position in the paragraph?)
  * Whose story is being told in each sentence? (How do you move that information to the Topic position in the sentence?)
  * Is the main action in the sentence being told by the verb? (Do you need to switch from a nominalization to an active verb?)
  * Which pieces of old information connect the sentence backward to the previous discourse? (How do you move that information to the Topic position?)
  * Are sentences in a paragraph using topic changing or topic stringing?
* Steps to revise a piece of writing:
  * Reread the prose several times, looking at each major reader expectation separately.
  * Look at the verbs of each sentence in the paragraph.
  * Determine if those verbs are weak or strong. (Strong verbs articulate the REAL action of the sentence the author intends.)
  * Look at subject-verb and verb-complement separations. (Long subject-verb separations make the sentence hard to interpret for the reader.)
  * Does the topic position of each sentence have the correct entity for the intended story?
  * Does each sentence have the old information needed for the link backward in the Topic position?
  * Is stressworthy information in the stress positions? (Just before a period, semicolon, or colon)
  * Determine if topic changing or topic stringing is going on. Does the relationship between sentence beginnings direct the reader's attention as intended?
  * Is the paragraph's issue in the first one to three sentences?
  * Does the paragraph have a point? Is it articulated in the correct place?
  * If the paragraph is narrative and doesn't have a point, is that indicated in the first sentence or two?

### Some interesting thoughts

* Meaning comes from context.
* There are no firm rules.
* This method focuses on the reader.
* Most readers go through the same interpretation process most of the time.
* On why it's important to craft your writing to influence the reader: "A major part of growing up is the transformation from being someone who merely responds and obeys to being someone who chooses and controls." p. 184 (I'm trying to teach students to take control of their writing.)
* "Placement of information highly influences what kind of synthesis a reader will experience in trying to form information into idea." p. 207

### The basic structure of a sentence

* TOPIC POSITION [the backward link; answer to the question, "whose story?"]
* VERB [the action]
* MIDSENTENCE [all other nonstressworthy information]
* STRESS POSITION [that which the sentence was created to emphasize]
* (Gopen, 2004b, p. 63)

### Use of punctuation

* (Gopen, 2004b)
* History of punctuation:
  * Greek and Latin were written with no punctuation or spaces between words. This was possible because they both indicated grammatical relationships between words with case endings on individual words. Word order was less important in those languages. Also, delivery was often oral instead of written. This made distinguishing where one thought stopped, and another started easier. Scholars copying texts already knew the contents, so they didn't need punctuation.
  * As written distribution became more common, the need for punctuation to help unfamiliar readers understand where to start and stop became greater. (Early punctuation in those languages differentiated the purpose of the punctuation by the height of the mark. All used the same mark.) The spread of Christianity with written language also brought about the more sophisticated use of punctuation starting around the sixth century.
* **semicolon**
  * least well-understood of the punctuation marks
  * used for 1400 years
  * common reader response - pause more than if they'd seen a comma, but less than if they'd seen a period
  * messages of the semicolon
    * place of full syntactic closure
    * end of clause that can stand as an independent sentence
    * the next clause is also an independent clause that can stand as an independent sentence
    * the two clauses have a very close relationship with each other
    * stress this clause, but also expect stress at the end of the next clause
    * Main use #1 - These two clauses are two separate clauses, each with their own point to make; but together they make a point of even greater complexity and force.
    * Secondary use #2 - It separates examples of an immediately previous statement that has ended in a colon. This is not for short, simple lists. The previous use of the semicolon is more important.
* **colon**
   * What comes after the use of the colon is expected to either redefine or to exemplify that which came before it.
   * The clause before the colon can stand on it's own as a sentence.
   * What follows after the colon can be an independent sentence, but it will restate or redefine the first clause.
   * Or what comes after the colon is a list of examples that, taken together, will give you a fuller way of understanding the previously stated ideas.
   * Independent clause: Independent clause - The second clause can be capitalized or not, but Gopen encourages capitalizing it to distinguish this from a list.
   * The colon differs from the semicolon. The semicolon suggests further expansion of the thought or a significant addition. The colon suggests the reader will hear the first thought repeated in some helpful way. Semicolon expands while colon repeats.
   * Lists after a colon may be bullet points or numbered presented vertically. The clause before the colon should always be a full independent clause, but this grammar rule is starting to be ignored more often. Gopen discourages ignoring that rule because of the lack of a stress position at the colon. He asserts the reader will have a harder time interpreting the sentence if there is no syntactic closure at the colon. Each bullet item will receive a somewhat lower emphasis.
   * Colons and semicolons were used a great deal more in previous centuries.
* **Marks to indicate interruption**
   * All of these are loosely defined.
   * There is a lot of variability in how each is used.
   * **Dashes --**
     * Gopen recommends using the double dash to preclude confusion with hyphenation.
     * Only started being used about 300 years ago.
     * When used once in a sentence, it is similar to the colon. It invites the reader to simultaneously separate and join the two halves of the sentence.
     * When used as a pair, they function as parentheses or commas. They indicate an interruption in the middle of things.
     * The colon invites the reader to maintain a constant level of intensity before and after the colon.
     * The dash does the opposite. It raises the intensity of what follows the dash.
   * **(Parentheses)**
     * Parenthesis, like dashes, signal an interruption.
     * But they signal the opposite emphasis to dashes.
     * Parentheses lower the volume of the interruption, where dashes raise emphasis.
     * Parentheses establish a marked difference in tone when they're used more than once in a paragraph. Multiple parenthetical statements in a paragraph can seem to speak to each other.
     * There are no set rules on what punctuation can be used around parentheses.
   * **Commas**
     * Commas also signal an interruption.
     * Unlike dashes and parentheses, commas signal an interruption in sense, but not tone. (Dashes signal an increase in tone, while parentheses signal a lowering of tone.)
   * **[Brackets]**
     * Unlike dashes, parentheses, or commas, square brackets indicate a change in voice.
     * The brackets indicate that the writer is introducing his or her own voice as an author rather than the more fictional voice of the narrator.
     * When brackets are used in a direct quotation, they indicate the original words of the quote have been changed.
     * They can also be used inside parentheses to avoid the confusion of multiple parentheses nested within each other.
* **hyphen**
  * The hyphen joins and separates at the same time.
  * Many words that once were hyphenated have become joined into single words. This is an ongoing process that still continues.
  * Hyphenating words helps the reader to understand more clearly what should be joined.
  * Hyphens are also used by printers to break apart words at the end of a line for printing purposes.
* **question mark**
  * An interrogative word and a question mark usually raise and close a question.
  * Indirect questions are sometimes incorrectly ended with a question mark. (An indirect question is a sentence indicating that someone asked a question.)
  * Here are some of Gopen's suggestions on using question marks:
    * Use it little, if at all, in formal writing.
    * It is used more often in educational writing, letters, and emails.
  * A rhetorical question should only be used in special circumstances:
    * It presumes a single obvious yes or no answer.
    * It is asked in place of making an argument when suggesting no argument is necessary.
    * Rhetorical questions are a risky rhetorical device.
* **artificial emphasis**
  * Many dislike the exclamation point!
  * The exclamation point goes beyond offering syntactic and rhetorical directions to the reader and tries to imply how the reader should feel about something.
  * Other forms of artificial emphasis:
    * Underlining (There's not a good way to do that in Markdown because it's confused with hyperlinks.)
    * **boldface**
    * CAPITAL LETTERS
    * *italics*
  * There are two main times to use artificial emphasis:
    * Add emphasis when no natural way is available.
    * When the writer needs to restructure the sentence to add emphasis in a better way and hasn't thought of how to do that yet. (Use of artificial emphasis is discouraged.)
* **apostrophe**
  * Use to form a contraction.
  * Used to signal possession.
* **ellipsis ...**
  * Indicates words or sentences left out of a quotation.
  * It may be four dots if the words were followed by a period.
  * Omission at the end of a sentence - a space follows the last word and then four dots.
  * Omission of an entire sentence - A period comes at the end of the sentence, and then three dots. (No space after last word.)
* **period**
  * A period indicates the end of a sentence and prepares a reader to be ready for the next one.
  * A period provides a sense of closure.
  * Problems with not using periods correctly include the sentence fragment and the run-on sentence.
  * Periods are also used for abbreviations.
* **comma**
  * The comma is the only punctuation mark that does not announce it's purpose upon arrival. You have to go past the comma to determine the function.
  * The comma is the most common punctuation mark. (Possibly used twice as much as all other punctuation marks combined.)
  * Comma misuse may account for a quarter of all grammatical errors.
  * It serves a larger number of functions than any other mark.
  * There is no simple rule, nor any simple set of rules, that will make the multiple uses of the comma clear and easy.
  * "Ask not what the comma rules demand of you but rather how you can use the comma to take better care of your reader's needs." (Gopen, 2004b, p. 231)
  * Here is a partial list of comma uses:
    * to distinguish nonrestrictive elements from restrictive elements
    * to mark the boundaries of interruptive material
    * to mark transitional material
    * to mark contracting material
    * to separate the members of a series
    * to separate clauses in a sentence
    * to separate introductory material from the main clause
    * to separate adverbs and adjectives that together modify a single noun
    * to mark direct address
    * to introduce direct address after a verb that identifies the speaker
    * to keep in order dates, addresses, numbers, and titles

### A more graphical depiction of suggested paragraph organization

* These diagrams are my own creations based on his descriptions (Gopen, 2004a).

First paragraph in a paper:  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Expected point]  

Middle paragraph in a paper (Type 1 - most common):  
*[Possible reach back to connect to preceding material]*  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Possible point - last sentence of Issue]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Possible point]  
*[Possible coda]*  
*[Possible reach forward to indicate things to come]*  

Middle paragraph in a paper (Type 2 - has dramatic point):  
*[Possible reach back to connect to preceding material]*  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Point at end for dramatic effect]  
*[Possible coda]*  
*[Possible reach forward to indicate things to come]*  

Middle paragraph in a paper (Type 3 - paragraph has complexity and dramatic point):  
*[Possible reach back to connect to preceding material]*  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Point at beginning and end]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Point at beginning and end]  
*[Possible coda]*  
*[Possible reach forward to indicate things to come]*  

Last paragraph in a paper:  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Expected point]  

## Preface

* Meaning comes from context.
* There are no firm rules.
* This method focuses on the reader.
* Most readers go through the same interpretation process most of the time.

## Interpretation

### How to teach writing

* Understand students' composing habits that inform rhetorical choices.
* Don't treat the writing as more important than the writer.
* Help students understand the relationship between thought and communication of thought.
* Help students understand how readers read, so they can convey their intended meaning.

### Problems with interpreting writing

* Readers do the interpreting.
* All text is infinitely interpretable.
* Reader energy is limited.
* Readers must perceive both structure and substance.
* Solution: **"Readers of English have reflectively fixed expectations of where in the structure of any unit of discourse to expect the arrival of certain kinds of substance."** p. 11
* Don't violate reader expectations
  * Use sentence stress positions correctly.
  * Consider reader energy when constructing sentences and paragraphs.

## Action and Agency

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the action of a sentence to be articulated by the verb."** p. 25
* Be careful not to hide the true action of a sentence in nominalizations.
* Advice: **"Usually express the action of a sentence as a verb."** p. 32
* Advice: **"Usually use verbs only for expressing actions."** p. 33
* Use nominalization or passive construction to avoid showing agency.

## Subject-Verb-Complement Separations

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect every grammatical subject will be followed almost immediately by its verb."** p. 58
* Words appearing between the subject and verb in a sentence are perceived as less important by the reader.
* Let the agent appear as the subject of the verb if it is important to let the reader know who is doing the action.

## Topic and Stress Positions

* Advice: **"Whenever possible, try to locate the various types of substancee in the structural locations where readers expect those types of substance to arrive."** p. 78
* Reader expectation: **"Readers tend to read a clause -- or a one-clause sentence -- as being the story of whoever or whatever shows up first."** p. 81
* ALL interpretation depends on context.
* Reader expectation: **"In a multiclause sentence, readers tend to read the entire sentence as the story of whoever or whatever shows up first in the main clause."** p. 88
* The way sentences connect with each other is very important.
* Two important structural positions in a sentence are the topic position and the stress position.
* Judge a sentence by how well it connects with its neighbors and sends instructions on how to value its components.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the material at the beginning of a sentence to provide a connection backward to the sentence that precedes it."** p. 90
* Four key words of the reader expectation approach: expectation, structure, substance, context.
* Advice: **"Whose story? + backwards link = context"** p. 95
* The topic position usually extends until the grammatical subject is reached.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect that materials to the left contextualize anything that comes to its right. Readers expect that the occupants of the topic position contextualize the reader for the rest of the sentence."** p. 101
* Reader expectation: **"Today's readers of American English expect to find the most important information of a sentence located in a stress position."** p. 102
* Most English sentences are read with the expectation that the most important information will come at the end.
* You can combine multiple items in the stress position at the end of a sentence by creating a numbered list.
* Reader expectation: **"Contemporary readers of American English sentences expect to find the most important information in a stress position. A stress position is any moment of full syntactic closure."** p. 108
* The colon has two main uses. In both instances, what precedes the colon should be able to be an independent sentence. What follows the colon redefines what preceded it. The second clause is capitalized. The other use of the colon is to introduce a list of examples. The second clause after the colon clarifies.
* The semicolon is used where two clauses need to be connected in the same syntactic unit. The second clause is more important than the first and adds complexity.
* The major punctuation marks that create stress points are the colon, the semicolon, and the period. The stress point is the end of the clause where the punctuation is used when full syntactic closure is achieved.
* Advice: **"A sentence is too long when it contains more viable candidates for Stress positions than it has Stress positions. A sentence is too short when it contains no viable candidates for the Stress position."** p. 112
* Advice: **"Fill every stress position with something stressworthy; and ensure that everything stressworthy occupies a stress position."** p. 113
* Advice: **"You can use underlines for words to add stress when that work is difficult to move to the stress position because of grammar."** p. 118
* Nouns carry more weight than pronouns.
* Structural arrangements carries 85% of stress. Word choice carries 15%.

## Using Topic/Stress to Develop the Paragraph

### Revising sentences

* Which piece of new information deserves the most emphasis?
* How to move that to the stress position?
* Whose story is each sentence?
* Which pieces of old information connect the sentence backward to previous discourse?
* How to move that information to the topic position?

### Multiple Uses of Stress Position

* Advice: **"The stress position of a sentence that ends a document should usually afford the reader a full sense of closure."** p. 160
* Advice: **"The stress position that ends a segment or section of a document either should produce a document-ending kind of closure or should perform a more subtle two-stranded task -- bringing closure to the present section while leaning forward to introduce or link to the approaching section."** p. 160
* Use the stress position to indicate a change in topic: 1) Place new information in the stress position. 2) New information is not self-explanatory. This indicates to the reader that more explanation is coming.
* Muliple Strands (tells a story) - the subject of the story may be in the topic position for several sentences and new information about the story in the stress position for those.
* Epistrophic Emphasis (repeat same phrase) - Repeat the same word or phrase in the stress position for several sentences. (Should be used infrequently.)
* Intentional Anticlimax - Put less important information in the stress position. (Takes the edge off emphasis of bad news.)

### Topic Changing (Chaining) and Topic Stringing

* Topic Changing (Chaining) - The key word in the topic position refers back to the same key word in the stress position of the previous sentence. (Produces a domino effect. Focuses on links and connectedness.)
* Topic Stringing - The topic remains the same for several sentences. Allows complex information to be conveyed about the same topic.
* **"Readers need more than just the building blocks of information; they need the instructions for assembly."** p. 169
* The topic position indicates "who's story". Switching subjects in the topic position often in a paragraph can make it feel disjointed.
* **"The reader will know to value one lexical string over all the others if the lexical string is also the topical string."** p. 176
* **"Construct topic strings when you wish to develop a point of view or an argument continuously, from its basis to its conclusion"** p. 178

### Seeking Control Over Reader Response

* "A major part of growing up is the transformation from being someone who merely responds and obeys to being someone who chooses and controls." p. 184

## Paragraphs: Issues, Points, and Purposes

* For readers, the unit of thought is the paragraph. Nicely written sentences are not enough.
* The five-sentence paragraph structure is too rigid for professional writing.
* Paragraph's internal structure and place in larger context of document should be considered. Reader's interpret a paragraph as they read, sentence by sentence. We need to understand the distinction between the issue (topic), the point (intellectual claim), and the purpose (function performed in the discourse as a whole).

### Issue

* Context controls meaning. Whatever shows up first is perceived by the reader as the topic.
* Whatever shows up in the first one to three sentences of a paragraph will be perceived as the paragraph issue by readers.
* "Placement of information highly influences what kind of synthesis a reader will experience in trying to form information into idea." p. 207
* The shape of a paragraph should not be predetermined. The shape should be suggested by the shape and complexity of the thought being presented.
* What does a paragraph do? It does one or more of the following. It offers cohesion. It presents unity. It indicates purpose. It raises an issue. It makes a point. It tells a story. It generates development. It provides coherence. It creates shape. p. 207
* Reader expectations for paragraphs are similar to expectations for sentences. "Whose story is it?" is largely determined by what shows up at the beginning.
* Narrative paragraphs don't need to articulate a point because they are establishing knowledge that will be supportive of points made later in the text. p. 211

### Point

* In professional prose, the issue being discussed and the point being made in a paragraph are not always the same thing.
* The Issue refers to the intellectual geographic boundaries within which the discussion will wander; the Point is the place within those boundaries at which we wish the reader to arrive. p 212
* There are two locations in a paragraph readers expect to find the point. If the point is not found in the first, readers will look for it in the second.
* It's possible to leave the point unarticulated, but risky. The times to NOT state the point are when the point is EXTREMELY clear, when more arguments still need to be presented, when you intend to present a question without articulating an answer.
* coda - a (often pithy) summary at the end of a section
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the point sentence in a paragraph (if any) to arrive at one of two places: either (1) as the last sentence of the issue; or (2) as the last sentence of the discussion."** p. 222
* Reader expectation restated: **"Readers expect the point of a paragraph to be made explicit either just before the discussion of it begins or just as the discussion of it ends."** p. 223

Paragraph structure so far:  
[Issue: one, two, or three sentences]  
[Possible point]  
[Discussion can be short or long]  
[Possible point]  
[Possible coda]  

#### Point Placement and Paragraph Types

* First paragraphs: readers expect the point of the opening paragraph to arrive at the end.
* Last paragraphs: readers also expect the point of a concluding paragraph to arrive at the end.
* Most medial paragraphs: readers expect the point at the beginning of the discussion.
* Medial paragraphs with clear and dramatic point: point is at the end for dramatic effect.
* Medial paragraphs with complexity and dramatic point: point is at the beginning of the discussion AND at the end.
* One-sentence paragraphs: Should fill all rhetorical requirements for a paragraph - clearly stated issue, clearly ascertainable point, sufficient discussion to establish the point. (The issue can be stated in one sentence. The issue and the point are the same. All the discussion that supports the Point must have happened already in previous paragraphs or will happen immediately after the single-sentence paragraph.)

### Purpose

* Issue and Point look at the internal structure of paragraphs. Purpose is the role the paragraph plays in the larger unit of discourse. Purpose is the relationship between the current paragraph and the other paragraphs surrounding it before and after.
* The purpose is a bit more nebulous to determine and articulate because it depends on the reader's perception of what is going on rhetorically in the rest of the work.
* Writing and reading are acts of interpretation. The act of writing forces one through the act of interpretation. Writing and thinking can not be clearly separated from each other; nor should writing and reading. p. 236

### The Writer's Power to Shape and Change Reader Expectations Concerning Paragraph Structure

* These expectations are what is most common. You can write to other expectations, but it risks reader misinterpretation.
* You can use metadiscourse to tell the reader what is going on. (Writing about the writing instead of writing about the topic.)
* Parallel construction: You can both use it and violate it for effect.

### Pointless Paragraphs

* Some paragraphs may just be narrative, so they don't need to have a point.
* The writer may intend for the reader to interpret the point, but this risks misinterpretation by the reader.
* The writer has not thought through things enough to supply the point to the reader.

### Connections Between Paragraphs

* In both sentences and paragraphs, the reader is looking for the connection between what came before and what is coming after. The options to help supply this is 1) signaling forward at the end of the previous paragraph; 2) motioning backward at the beginning of the new unit; or 3) doing both. p. 251
* At the sentence level, the occupant of the stress position of the previous sentence often be the future linkage. But this is not necessary. Any important word in a sentence can become the old information in the topic position and take over the storyline.
* Typical expectations of the reader for a new paragraph: 1) It may begin where the previous paragraph left off. 2) It might continue to develop the issue of the previous paragraph and start from where the previous paragraph started. 3) It might pick a detail from the previous paragraph to expand upon. 4) It might shift to a topic the reader has not been led to expect. (dramatic) Readers like to be told ASAP which of these is happening.
* It's common to link back to the issue or the point of the previous paragraph.

### A Note on Whole Documents

* Professional fields often define the structure of whole documents. It is not necessary to discuss those requirements at length when discussing the mechanics of writing.

## Learning and Teaching Reader Expectation Approach

* Generalizations of reader expectations:
* Readers wish to be contextualized at the beginning of discourse units. (sentences, paragraphs)
* Readers will look for context in the locations expected. (Topic position of sentence, Issue position of paragraph)
* Readers have a great need for closure. They will give natural emphasis to the end of a unit of discourse. (End of sentence, End of first and last paragraphs)

### Initial Procedure for Employing REA

* Which of the writer's rhetorical habits are already helpful to the reader and which are not.
* Reread the prose several times, looking at each major reader expectation separately.
* look at the verbs of each sentence in the paragraph
* are verbs weak or strong (do the verbs articulate THE action of the sentence?)
* look at subject-verb and verb-complement separations
* Does the opic position of each sentence has the correct entity for the intended story?
* Does each sentence has the old information needed for the link backward in the Topic position?
* Is stressworthy information in the stress positions (period, semicolon, colon)?
* Determine if topic changing or topic stringing is going on. Does the relationship between sentence beginnings direct the reader's attention as intended?
* Is the paragraph's issue in the first one to three sentences?
* Does the paragraph have a point? Is it articulated in the correct place?
* If the paragraph is narrative and doesn't have a point, is that indicated in the first sentence or two?

### Teaching

* Teach inductively - walk through examples first, then state the principle
