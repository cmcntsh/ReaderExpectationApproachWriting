# Notes on the Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

These notes come from the text Expectations: Teaching Writing from the Reader's Perspective by George D. Gopen.

## Preface

* Meaning comes from context.
* There are no firm rules.
* This method focuses on the reader.
* Most readers go through the same interpretation process most of the time.

## Interpretation

### How to teach writing

* Understand students' composing habits that inform rhetorical choices.
* Don't treat the writing as more important than the writer.
* Help students understand the relationship between thought and communication of thought.
* Help students understand how readers read, so they can convey their intended meaning.

### Problems with interpreting writing

* Readers do the interpreting.
* All text is infinitely interpretable.
* Reader energy is limited.
* Readers must perceive both structure and substance.
* Solution: **"Readers of English have reflectively fixed expectations of where in the structure of any unit of discourse to expect the arrival of certain kinds of substance."** p. 11
* Don't violate reader expectations
  * Use sentence stress positions correctly.
  * Consider reader energy when constructing sentences and paragraphs.

## Action and Agency

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the action of a sentence to be articulated by the verb."** p. 25
* Be careful not to hide the true action of a sentence in nominalizations.
* Advice: **"Usually express the action of a sentence as a verb."** p. 32
* Advice: **"Usually use verbs only for expressing actions."** p. 33
* Use nominalization or passive construction to avoid showing agency.

## Subject-Verb-Complement Separations

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect every grammatical subject will be followed almost immediately by its verb."** p. 58
* Words appearing between the subject and verb in a sentence are perceived as less important by the reader.
* Let the agent appear as the subject of the verb if it is important to let the reader know who is doing the action.

## Topic and Stress Positions

* Advice: **"Whenever possible, try to locate the various types of substancee in teh structural locations where readers expect those types of substance to arrive."** p. 78
* Reader expectation: **"Readers tend to read a clause -- or a one-clause sentence -- as being the story of whoever or whatever shows up first."** p. 81
* ALL interpretation depends on context.
* Reader expectation: **"In a multiclause sentence, readers tend to read the entire sentence as the story of whoever or whatever shows up first in the main clause."** p. 88
* The way sentences connect with each other is very important.
* Two important structural positions in a sentence are the topic position and the stress position.
* Judge a sentence by how well it connects with its neighbors and sends instructions on how to value its components.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the material at the beginning of a sentence to prvide a connection backward to the sentence that precedes it."** p. 90
* Four key words of the reader expectation approach: expectation, structure, substance, context.
* Advice: **"Whose story? + backwards link = context"** p. 95
* The topic position usually extends until the grammatical subject is reached.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect that materials to the left contextualizes anything that comes to its right. Readers expect that the occupants of the topic position contectualize the reader for the rest of the sentence."** p. 101
* Reader expectation: **"Today's readers of American English expect to find the most important information of a sentence located in a stress position."** p. 102
* Most English sentences are read with the expectation that the most important information will come at the end.
