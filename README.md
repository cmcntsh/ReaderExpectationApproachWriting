# Notes on the Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

These notes come from the text Expectations: Teaching Writing from the Reader's Perspective by George D. Gopen.

## Preface

* Meaning comes from context.
* There are no firm rules.
* This method focuses on the reader.
* Most readers go through the same interpretation process most of the time.

## Interpretation

### How to teach writing

* Understand students' composing habits that inform rhetorical choices.
* Don't treat the writing as more important than the writer.
* Help students understand the relationship between thought and communication of thought.
* Help students understand how readers read, so they can convey their intended meaning.

### Problems with interpreting writing

* Readers do the interpreting.
* All text is infinitely interpretable.
* Reader energy is limited.
* Readers must perceive both structure and substance.
* Solution: **"Readers of English have reflectively fixed expectations of where in the structure of any unit of discourse to expect the arrival of certain kinds of substance."** p. 11
* Don't violate reader expectations
  * Use sentence stress positions correctly.
  * Consider reader energy when constructing sentences and paragraphs.

## Action and Agency

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the action of a sentence to be articulated by the verb."** p. 25
* Be careful not to hide the true action of a sentence in nominalizations.
* Advice: **"Usually express the action of a sentence as a verb."** p. 32
* Advice: **"Usually use verbs only for expressing actions."** p. 33
* Use nominalization or passive construction to avoid showing agency.

## Subject-Verb-Complement Separations

* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect every grammatical subject will be followed almost immediately by its verb."** p. 58
* Words appearing between the subject and verb in a sentence are perceived as less important by the reader.
* Let the agent appear as the subject of the verb if it is important to let the reader know who is doing the action.

## Topic and Stress Positions

* Advice: **"Whenever possible, try to locate the various types of substancee in teh structural locations where readers expect those types of substance to arrive."** p. 78
* Reader expectation: **"Readers tend to read a clause -- or a one-clause sentence -- as being the story of whoever or whatever shows up first."** p. 81
* ALL interpretation depends on context.
* Reader expectation: **"In a multiclause sentence, readers tend to read the entire sentence as the story of whoever or whatever shows up first in the main clause."** p. 88
* The way sentences connect with each other is very important.
* Two important structural positions in a sentence are the topic position and the stress position.
* Judge a sentence by how well it connects with its neighbors and sends instructions on how to value its components.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect the material at the beginning of a sentence to prvide a connection backward to the sentence that precedes it."** p. 90
* Four key words of the reader expectation approach: expectation, structure, substance, context.
* Advice: **"Whose story? + backwards link = context"** p. 95
* The topic position usually extends until the grammatical subject is reached.
* Reader expectation: **"Readers expect that materials to the left contextualize anything that comes to its right. Readers expect that the occupants of the topic position contextualize the reader for the rest of the sentence."** p. 101
* Reader expectation: **"Today's readers of American English expect to find the most important information of a sentence located in a stress position."** p. 102
* Most English sentences are read with the expectation that the most important information will come at the end.
* You can combine multiple items in the stress position at the end of a sentence by creating a numbered list.
* Reader expectation: **"Contemporary readers of American English sentences expect to find the most important information in a stress position. A stress position is any moment of full syntactic closure."** p. 108
* The colon has two main uses. In both instances, what precedes the colon should be able to be an independent sentence. What follows the colon redefines what preceded it. The second clause is capitalized. The other use of the colon is to introduce a list of examples. The second clause after the colon clarifies.
* The semicolon is used where two clauses need to be connected in the same syntactic unit. The second clause is more important than the first and adds complexity.
* The major punctuation marks that create stress points are the colon, the semicolon, and the period. The stress point is the end of the clause where the punctuation is used when full syntactic closure is achieved.
* Advice: **"A sentence is too long when it contains more viable candidates for Stress positions than it has Stress positions. A sentence is too short when it contains no viable candidates for the Stress position."** p. 112
* Advice: **"Fill every stress position with something stressworthy; and ensure that everything stressworthy occupies a stress position."** p. 113
* Advice: **"You can use underlines for words to add stress when that work is difficult to move to the stress position because of grammar."** p. 118
* Nouns carry more weight than pronouns.
* Structural arrangements carries 85% of stress. Word choice carries 15%.

## Using Topic/Stress to Develop the Paragraph

### Revising sentences

* Which piece of new information deserves the most emphasis?
* How to move that to the stress position?
* Whose story is each sentence?
* Which pieces of old information connect the sentence backward to previous discourse?
* How to move that information to the topic position?

### Additional Info

* Advice: **"The stress position of a sentence that ends a document should usually afford the reader a full sense of closure."** p. 160 **"The stress position that ends a segment or section of a document either should produce a document-ending kind of closure or should perform a more subtle two-stranded task -- bringing closure to the present section while leaning forward to introduce or link to the approaching section."** p. 160
